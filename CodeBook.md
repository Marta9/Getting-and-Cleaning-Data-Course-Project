Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project_CODEBOOK


Instructions for project The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Description of the DATA and Variables

Description of abbreviations of measurements

    leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
    Body = related to body movement.
    Gravity = acceleration of gravity
    Acc = accelerometer measurement
    Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
    Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
    Mag = magnitude of movement
    mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation

Files in folder ‘UCI HAR Dataset’ that will be used are:

    SUBJECT FILES

    test/subject_test.txt
    train/subject_train.txt

    ACTIVITY FILES

    test/X_test.txt
    train/X_train.txt

    DATA FILES

    test/y_test.txt
    train/y_train.txt

    features.txt - Names of column variables in the dataTable

    activity_labels.txt - Links the class labels with their activity name.

Finally, The tidy data set a set of variables for each activity and each subject. 10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns – 33 Mean variables + 33 Standard deviation variables + 1 Subject( 1 of of the 30 test subjects) + ActivityName + ActivityNum . The tidy data set’s first row is the header containing the names for each column.
