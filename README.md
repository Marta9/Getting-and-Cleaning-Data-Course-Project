This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps:
    
    Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
    
    Load the activity and feature info
    
    Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
   
    Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
    
    Merges the two datasets
    
    Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
    
    Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file TidyData.txt.
